      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hello, there! My name is Sam Zyra. I'm 26 years old and just moved to Oregon with my wife and our two cats. I graduated in December 2019 with a BA in English, Technical and Professional Writing - then I got married the next day!</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I grew up in Norman, Oklahoma and moved to Bloomington, Indiana at age 14, two weeks before my freshman year of high school. I now live near Portland, Oregon.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>In my free time I'm a writer and a gamer. I write some poetry and have had two poem published in Tributaries, a literary magazine done by IU East. I also write sci-fantasy and love world-building. Games-wise, I play a lot of Star War: The Old Republic, Minecraft (and various mods in it), and Destiny 2.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I would love to work in the marketing department for a company that I could be proud of, but as far as dreams go? I want to be a screen-writer. I love my stories, or at least the few that I finish, and the worlds I build to write them in, but I've always dreamed of seeing my worlds brought to life on the big screen.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>As stated before, I currently live near Portland Oregon and have for all of a week, as of the day I'm writing this. It's already wowed me with gorgeous trees and mountains, and the climate is infinitely more appealing than the humidity and heat of Bloomington.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>Web development is a massive part of any marketing job, and it's a growing market all on its own. As a human being with a need to eat, I want to learn these skills in order to find and land a career that I can enjoy and still survive by. Coding in general has more appeal to me, however, given its wide range of applications in game development and CGI.</p>
